# GRAPHMD:A TWO-MODULE DIFFUSION FRAMEWORK FOR SMOOTH AND CONSISTENT MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
Source code for our 

**Task Example**: A two-module molecular dynamics simulation approach: a molecular graph interaction module enhanced with classical potential functions, and a diffusion module that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to better capture smooth molecular motions.

# Approach

# Download and prepare the datasets
1. Download the MD17 dataset.

- [ActivityNet Captions C3D feature](https://example.com/ActivityNet_C3D.zip)

2.After downloading, unzip the files and place them under the `data/` directory:

data/
