# GRAPHMD:A TWO-MODULE DIFFUSION FRAMEWORK FOR SMOOTH AND CONSISTENT MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
Source code for our 

**Task Example**: A two-module molecular dynamics simulation approach: a molecular graph interaction module enhanced with classical potential functions, and a diffusion module that leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to better capture smooth molecular motions.
